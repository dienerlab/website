title = "Shaping of the intestinal environment by the human gut microbiome"
+++

A large fraction of anything we eat will eventually make its way into the intestine
where it comes into contact with the trillions of microorganisms residing there.
Those commensal microbes have a staggering flexibility in consuming or modifying compounds
in their environment affecting the chemical profile of the human intestine.

We are interested in the role microbes play in determining the chemical make-up of the
human gut. This is not limited to dietary compounds but also pharmaceutical drugs
(especially statins), host-derived compounds (such as hepatic metabolites and mucins), and
xenobiotics.

Questions we are interested in are:

- How does microbial metabolism alter the **bioavailability or activity of dietary components**?
- What is the **influence of microbially-derived metabolites** in providing a growth environment for
  a **stable gut microbiome**?
- How can we leverage the human gut microbiome to **modulate drug efficacy or limit side effects**?
