title = "Predicting intervention effects in the gut microbiome"
+++

In the last decades we have generated a panacea of information on how the gut microbiome
is altered in different diseases and how the transfer of the microbiome from one individual
to another can alleviate some diseases.

However, to leverage microbiome treatments in the clinic we need clear and defined strategies
for interventions and their effects on the human host. We leverage combinations of computational
strategies to build virtual gut microbiomes ("digital twins") and simplified experimental models
to study and predict the effect of interventions on the human gut microbiome and the host.

Questions we are interested in are:

- Are there **probiotic strains that can exert large effects on the gut microbiome (keystone taxa)** and enrich desired fucntions?
- How can we design **personalized microbiome interventions** at scale?
- Can an efficient **interventions strategy be predicted from the composition and genetics** of a particular gut microbiome?
