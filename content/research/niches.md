The trillions of microorganisms living in our gut (as well as the 70 gigatons carbon of microbes on
the planet) perform a complex ballet of metabolic interactions between each other and their
environment, giving rise to a myriad of biotransformations.

We study the flexibility of microorganisms
in adapting their nutrient needs and their interactions with surrounding microbes in varying environments
with a focus on how this may impact health and disease in the human gut.

Questions we are interested in are:

- Can we use genomic information to **mechanistically predict metabolite uptake and
  production** in a specific microbiome and environmental context?
- What is the **impact of the environments on the microbial niche space**?
- Can **niche dynamics predict engraftment** and priority effects during the colonization by
  pathogens or probiotics?

We address these questions using computational and wetlab approaches including
metagenomics, metabolomics, modeling, and single-cell culturomics.
