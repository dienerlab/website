Dietary intake is tightly coupled to gut microbiota composition, human metabolism and
the incidence of virtually all major chronic diseases. Dietary and nutrient intake are
usually assessed using self-reporting methods, including dietary questionnaires and food
records, which suffer from reporting biases and require strong compliance from study
participants. Here, we present Metagenomic Estimation of Dietary Intake (MEDI): a method
for quantifying food-derived DNA in human faecal metagenomes. We show that
DNA-containing food components can be reliably detected in stool-derived metagenomic
data, even when present at low abundances (more than ten reads). We show how MEDI
dietary intake profiles can be converted into detailed metabolic representations of
nutrient intake. MEDI identifies the onset of solid food consumption in infants, shows
significant agreement with food frequency questionnaire responses in an adult population
and shows agreement with food and nutrient intake in two controlled-feeding studies.
Finally, we identify specific dietary features associated with metabolic syndrome in a
large clinical cohort without dietary records, providing a proof-of-concept for detailed
tracking of individual-specific, health-relevant dietary patterns without the need for
questionnaires.
