The human gut pathogen Clostridioides difficile displays substantial inter-strain
genetic variability and confronts a changeable nutrient landscape in the gut. We
examined how human gut microbiota inter-species interactions influence the growth and
toxin production of various C. difficile strains across different nutrient environments.
Negative interactions influencing C. difficile growth are prevalent in an environment
containing a single highly accessible resource and sparse in an environment containing
C. difficile-preferred carbohydrates. C. difficile toxin production displays significant
community-context dependent variation and does not trend with growth-mediated
inter-species interactions. C. difficile strains exhibit differences in interactions
with Clostridium scindens and the ability to compete for proline. Further, C. difficile
shows substantial differences in transcriptional profiles in co-culture with C. scindens
or Clostridium hiranonis. C. difficile exhibits massive alterations in metabolism and
other cellular processes in co-culture with C. hiranonis, reflecting their similar
metabolic niches. C. hiranonis uniquely inhibits the growth and toxin production of
diverse C. difficile strains across different nutrient environments and robustly
ameliorates disease severity in mice. In sum, understanding the impact of C. difficile
strain variability and nutrient environments on inter-species interactions could help
improve the effectiveness of anti-C. difficile strategies.
