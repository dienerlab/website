Clostridioides difficile (C. difficile) colonizes up to 40% of community-dwelling adults
without causing disease but can eventually lead to infection (C. difficile infection
[CDI]). There has been a lack of focus on how to prevent colonization and facilitate the
successful clearance of C. difficile prior to the emergence of CDI. We show that
microbial community-scale metabolic models (MCMMs) accurately predict C. difficile
colonization susceptibility in vitro and in vivo, offering mechanistic insights into
microbiota-specific interactions involving metabolites like succinate, trehalose, and
ornithine. MCMMs reveal distinct C. difficile metabolic niches—two growth-associated and
one non-growth-associated—observed across 15,204 individuals from five cohorts. We
further demonstrate that MCMMs can predict personalized C. difficile growth suppression
by a probiotic cocktail designed to replace fecal microbiota transplants (FMTs) for the
treatment of recurrent CDI, and we identify new probiotic targets for future validation.
MCMMs represent a powerful framework for predicting pathogen colonization and assessing
probiotic efficacy across diverse microbiota contexts.
