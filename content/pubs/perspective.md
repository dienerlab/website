Microbial consortia drive essential processes, ranging from nitrogen fixation in soils
to providing metabolic breakdown products to animal hosts. However, it is challenging to
translate the composition of microbial consortia into their emergent functional
capacities. Community-scale metabolic models hold the potential to simulate the outputs
of complex microbial communities in a given environmental context, but there is
currently no consensus for what the fitness function of an entire community should look
like in the presence of ecological interactions and whether community-wide growth
operates close to a maximum.

Transitioning from single-taxon genome-scale metabolic
models to multitaxon models implies a growth cone without a well-specified growth rate
solution for individual taxa. Here, we argue that dynamic approaches naturally overcome
these limitations, but they come at the cost of being computationally expensive.
Furthermore, we show how two nondynamic, steady-state approaches approximate dynamic
trajectories and pick ecologically relevant solutions from the community growth cone
with improved computational scalability.
