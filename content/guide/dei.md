### Overview

We value and honor the uniqueness of each individual and embrace diverse backgrounds and
viewpoints. We aim to prepare students, postdocs, and visiting scholars for their future
as scientists and citizens in an equitable, inclusive, multicultural society.


### Values

Our lab holds diversity, equity, and inclusion as core values and is committed to
upholding them.  Dimensions of diversity include, but are not limited to, race,
ethnicity, sexuality, gender identity, socioeconomic background, national or cultural
origins, religion, political beliefs, different abilities, neurodiversity, and
lifestyle. We will not tolerate any type of discrimination or bigotry.

We believe that supporting diversity, equity, and inclusion is an active processes that
requires continuous, intentional commitment to promote a healthy work environment and to
enable success of our team members and of our collective scientific mission.

We believe that our differences provide an opportunity to accelerate advances and
innovations in science by bringing diverse perspectives, talents, approaches, and
dialogue to solving key problems. Individual scientists have biases (scientific,
cultural, political, economic, esthetic, etc.), and these biases infiltrate our work.
Only by supporting a diverse set of perspectives can we hope to overcome these
individual biases, together. Our research is empowered and strengthened by our
diversity.

### Actions

We pledge to support diversity, equity, and inclusion through the following set of
actions:

* We think deeply about the people around us and and actively cultivate a sense of
  empathy by considering the world through their points-of-view. We promote a culture of
  open-mindedness, compassion, and inclusiveness among all team members.
* We engage in inclusive, active, and individualized learning and mentoring. Just as the
  Medical University of Graz strives to integrate personalized approaches into
  our healthcare, we strive to build adaptive/personalized approaches to training.
* We understand that when individuals come from different backgrounds, they bring
  different ideas and perspectives. We will be considerate of and supportive of those
  perspectives while also sharing our own culture and values.
* We promote cultural, personal, and individual expressions that contribute to
  meaningful interaction and dialogue, which help to build a welcoming, educational, and
  understanding community that is culturally informed.
* We engage in outreach and community involvement, including citizen science projects,
  and [open-access software and teaching materials](https://github.com/dienerlab).
* We acknowledge the existence of our unconscious biases and strive to identify and
  overcome them. [Check out this resource, designed to help you understand your own
  unconscious biases](https://implicit.harvard.edu/implicit/takeatest.html).
* As stated in our orientation document, we will always do our best to be kind and
  generous, and to acknowledge that we are fallible beings who will make mistakes that
  we will try to correct and learn from.
* We have an open-door policy -- Christian is happy to discuss any feedback or concerns
  regarding our diversity, equity, and inclusion policies.
