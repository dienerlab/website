      <description>The trillions of microorganisms living in our gut (as well as the 70 gigatons carbon of microbes on the planet) perform a complex ballet of metabolic interactions between each other and their environment, giving rise to a myriad of biotransformations.&#xA;We study the flexibility of microorganisms in adapting their nutrient needs and their interactions with surrounding microbes in varying environments with a focus on how this may impact health and disease in the human gut.</description>
